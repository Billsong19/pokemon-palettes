pokemon-palettes
================
Here's a little toy that lets you explore different color palettes composed of the pixels of individual
Pokemon sprites. Could be useful if you need inspiration on some projects (although, I have to admit, I
really just wanted it look pretty).

Ended up being more of an organizational challenge with Backbone. This was a rewrite of a project that 
I picked up to learn jQuery a bit better. I abandoned it after ~200 lines due to spaghetti overflow. 
(kept the file in old_stuff/) Backbone really cleaned it up this time around.


Site is live if you look through the projects on my website (peep the bio)
